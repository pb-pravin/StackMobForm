# StackMobForm
StackMobForm is an example application to demonstrate how well [StackMob's SDK](http://stackmob.com) and [Survey](http://github.com/wess/Survey) work together.  

Since StackMob uses CoreData/NSIncrementalStore, Survey is able to generate forms directly from a defined entity. So validating, saving is all cake. 

This example app is 2 controllers, one for listing your items, and one for adding items.  To setup you will just need to create an schema on StackMob with: title, details, note.  Then in SMFAppDelegate just flip the publicKey to your app's public key, and watch the magic happen.
